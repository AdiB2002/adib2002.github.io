I am an undergraduate student at The University of Texas at Austin studying Computer Science and Math. I've been fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="https://amypavel.com/">Amy Pavel</a>, where we developed a video editing tool for converting long-form videos into short-form videos. I also spent a summer in the <a href="https://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/meyers/">Meyers Lab</a>, supporting COVID-19 research through data collection and analysis. Currently, I'm spending the summer at the University of Washington working with Professor <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~axz/">Amy Zhang</a> helping users improve their algorithmically curated social media feeds.

My research interests lie broadly in humanâ€“AI interaction, with a focus on developing systems and models that help people. I'm excited about exploring how AI can support creative domains such as writing and video creation. An important challenge in this is finding the right balance between AI assistance and user control. I'm also interested in how AI is shaping our online social interactions, and how we can design tools that foster more positive outcomes.

Outside of research, some of my interests include rock climbing, Formula 1, college football, hanging out with friends, and coffee shops.
